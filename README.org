Chrome extension to automatically scroll buildbot logs.

 * Download it from Chrome webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buildbot-log-auto-scroll/achbanhpkobijjnjbcpcpkfoeiommkga
 * Source code: https://github.com/wanders/chrome-buildbot-autoscroll/

Pages with url's matching
`/builders/*/builds/*/steps/*/logs/stdio` will automatically
scroll to the end of the page and continues to do so as more output
appears. Manually scrolling to somewhere in the document will disable
automatic scrolling until document is manually scrolled to end.

* License

The icon is buildbot's standard icon which most likely is GPL-2
licenced.

The rest is using the MIT licence.
